    Like [Voltron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uS5b8aQ6z8),
    Pipewave and the good folks at [ZEFR](http://www.zefr.com) decided to join forces to become much stronger than either of us alone.
    Read about it [here](http://pandodaily.com/2013/01/07/zefr-acquires-pipewave-moves-toward-serving-both-brands-and-content-owners-on-youtube/).

    My formative years between undergrad and business school were spent at [Sapient](http://sapient.com).  Here, I cut my teeth on software
    development and process.  I really couldn't imagine a better first job out of school.

    I was the architect of the Advanced Technology Group, responsible for
    project design and quality of Sapientâ€™s portfolio of technical solutions for IT consulting clients. I
    formulated Sapient's strategy on emerging technologies, helped establish Sapient's first satellite office in
    India, and led teams of 10-40 multi-disciplinary consultants on major technology deployments.
