<h1>Music
  <small>My top 20 of all time</small>

<p>This was actually remarkably difficult. I set off to select the 20 albums that had the largest impact on my life.
  This is what I came up with (in no particular order).</p>

<div class="grid-x grid-padding-x small-up-1 medium-up-4 large-up-6">
  {{#each music}}
    <div class="cell"/>
       <img class="thumbnail" src="{{image}}" alt="{{album}}"/>
    </div>
  {{/each}}
</div>
